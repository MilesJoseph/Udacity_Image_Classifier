# Udacity Image Classification Project 

This repo contains a project for the Udacity Tensrflow nanodegree program. The project is fairly simple and consists of building an image classifier for the flowers dataset contained in Tensorflow datasets. 

# Details

The jupyter notebook gives a detailed account of the organization of this project's model development and exploration. The first step, broadly speaking was to load the data and orient it appropriately for a feed foward network. Next, we build the model, save the model and create a pipeline. 

# Prediction Application 

Finally, we build an application for others to use, this is contained in the predict.py
